# Marketer
Thank you for visiting my project.
The main purpose of the Marketer project is to create a user-friendly Android application that allows all the consumers to compare grocery prices across different markets. It has designed to provide a streamlined and efficient grocery shopping experience and to enable users to make informed decisions, cost savings, time saving and life expenses knowledge. Additionally, the application will provide insightful statistical data about personal inflation rates and life expenses.
